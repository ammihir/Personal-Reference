#Numpy is an amazing library and it is important to understand the syntax and the relationships within the syntax, it is with that 
#objective that I created this post.
#Most of my ML journey's have started with analysis on the MNIST dataset and so I have created this repository for personal reference.




from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("/tmp/data/", one_hot = True)

import numpy as np

plt.imshow(mnist.train.images[1].reshape(28,28),cmap='Greens')  # this is to just visualise the data point at the 1st position.
mnist.train.images[1]                                           # this will give the same as above but with array like format.


plt.imshow(mnist.train.images[0].reshape(28,28)*mnist.train.images[1].reshape(28,28),cmap="Reds")   #pointless, but we can see that
